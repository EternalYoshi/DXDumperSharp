# DXDumperSharp
A Tool I made to dump Dokapon DX's text.

This tool uses a specifically formatted table to read and dump text from Dokapon DX's .spt files.

To use it you need to select a .spt file, then a table file(I recommend the one included in this repository)

Then you type in the starting and ending offsets to read.

I haven't worked out where the text starts in files yet sorry.

Afterwards it will spit out a .txt file with all the text. Any unrecognized character will be put in square brackets.
